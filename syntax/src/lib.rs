/// language. This is done by taking in a string slice and outputting a vector of
/// [`Span`](struct.Span.html)s.

///
/// As it is certain that more variants will be added in future, this enum has been marked as
/// non-exhaustive. It is recommended that the wildcard that this implies catches not only any
/// future new variants, but also the `Unhighlighted` variant – this way you conveniently specify
/// that highlight groups you haven’t defined styles for yet get the same (lack of) highlighting
/// that unhighlighted text gets.
